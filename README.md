# tonemapper â€” A tool for exploring and applying various tonemapping operators.

## Description

Tonemapper is a an application to compare and apply various tone mapping operators...

1. ... either via the command line interface:

```
# Example: apply the "Reinhard" operator with gamma=2.2 to a list of input images
./tonemapper --operator reinhard --gamma 2.2 <images>
```

2. ... or via an interactive GUI:

```
./tonemapper --gui
```

### Supported file formats:

* **Input**: `.exr` & `.hdr`
* **Output**: `.jpg` & `.png`

### Available operators:

* **Gamma**: Standard gamma correction only
* **sRGB**: Conversion to sRGB color space

* **Clampling**
* **Maximum division**
* **Mean value**
* **Exponential**
* **Exponentiation**
* **Logarithmic**

## Building

Clone the repository recursively all dependencies and use CMake to generate project files for your favourite IDE or build system.

```
# Unix example using make:
git clone https://github.com/tizian/tonemapper.git --recursive
cd tonemapper
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Optionally, the compilation of the GUI can be disabled via a CMake option:
```
cmake .. -DTONEMAPPER_BUILD_GUI=OFF
```
